## Node name (local; no distribution needed for single-node container deployments)
-sname beamclaw

## Erlang cluster cookie — override with BEAMCLAW_COOKIE env var at runtime.
## The extended start script supports: ERL_FLAGS="-setcookie $BEAMCLAW_COOKIE"
-setcookie beamclaw_dev

## Heartbeat: uncomment to auto-restart the VM if the node stops responding.
## Useful in production; disable for interactive debugging.
## -heart

## Async thread pool size.
## Handles blocking I/O (file, port I/O) off the schedulers.
## 32 is a good starting point for I/O-heavy workloads.
+A 32

## Maximum open ports (file descriptors).
## Each open socket, file handle, and port consumes one entry.
+Q 65536

## Scheduler busy-wait threshold.
## "none" disables busy-wait entirely, reducing CPU burn when idle.
## Appropriate for latency-tolerant workloads (AI chat is bursty, not HFT).
+sbwt none

## Enable Unicode printable character detection.
## Required for io:format("~ts") to correctly handle non-Latin-1 codepoints.
+pc unicode

## Reduce memory footprint for idle schedulers.
+scl false

## Allow the VM to return memory to the OS more aggressively.

## Crash dump location (writable at runtime).
-env ERL_CRASH_DUMP /tmp/beamclaw_erl_crash.dump
